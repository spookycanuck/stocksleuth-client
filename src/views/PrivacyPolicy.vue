    <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
      under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection
      Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United
      States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells
      out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
      children's privacy and safety online.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
    </p>

    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
    <p>
      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
      in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
      significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
      globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
      should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
      that protect personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
      following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify
      you via email within 7 business days.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
      individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
      data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
      principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
      against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
      government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
      processors.
