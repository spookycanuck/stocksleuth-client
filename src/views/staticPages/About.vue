    <h2>What is Stock Sleuth?</h2>
    <p>
      At Stock Sleuth, we like to live by a simple motto: why spend a few hours
      researching something when we can spend thousands trying to automate it?
      Stock Sleuth was born out of a curiosity of the investing world and is a
      research tool to assist with understanding a particular stock's
      performance and media sentiment.

    <p>
      What started as a few lines of code for a simple web scraper evolved into
      a full-fledged application to aggregate disparate pieces of information to
      help investors make the most well-informed decisions in the least amount
      of time. We've automated the tedious tasks of tracking down information so
      you don't have to.

      so you don't have to. Of these sources, Stock Sleuth leverages
