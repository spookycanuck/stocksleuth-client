    <h2>How do I use Stock Sleuth?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put a stock symbol or company name into the search bar and click
      the magnifying glass button. It's that easy!
    </p>
    <h2>Why is the app so slow sometimes?</h2>
    <p>
      If no one is using the app for an extended period of time, the servers may
      be asleep and can take around 30 seconds to a minute to start back up.
    </p>
    <h2>Why isn't the website working?</h2>
    <p>
      Stock Sleuth is still in the early development phases, so it could be any
      number of reasons. If it suddenly stops, try reloading the page. If that
      doesn't work try closing your browser and clearing your cache.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are unable to resolve the issue, open your browser's developer
      tools and open the console. Take a screenshot of the console errors and
      email contact@stocksleuth.net and include and relevant information
      surrounding the error. We will address it as soon as we can and push fixes
      immediately.
